This website provides JavaScript tools to simplify the use of a standard celeration chart.

The standard celeration chart, also known as the six-cycle chart, is a semi-logarithmic means of recording the rate at which an event occurs. Originally created by Dr. Ogden Lindley, the chart is most widely used by Board-Certified Behavior Analysts and Behavior Technicians in order to chart the rates of behavior. Use of the chart has been a staple in the field since its inception, but charting rates of responding over a long duration involves some calculations which can be taxing when done repeatedly for each behavior of interest.

This website provides tools to calculate where to place a record floor on a standard celeration chart, where to mark frequency given a record floor, and also convert any score into rate per minute using the total time formula.
